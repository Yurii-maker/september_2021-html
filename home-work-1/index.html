<h1>System of a Down</h1>
<p>System of a Down (also known as SoaD or simply System) is an Armenian-American heavy metal band formed in Glendale,
    California, in 1994. It currently consists of members Serj Tankian (lead vocals, keyboards), Daron Malakian (guitar,
    vocals), Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals), and John Dolmayan (drums), who replaced original drummer Andy
    Khachaturian in 1997.[1]

    The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which debuted at number one on
    the US Billboard 200. System of a Down has been nominated for four Grammy Awards and their song "B.Y.O.B." won a
    Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2006. The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010. Other
    than two new songs in 2020 ("Protect the Land" and "Genocidal Humanoidz"),[2] System of a Down has not released a
    full-length record since the Mezmerize and Hypnotize albums in 2005. The band has sold over 40 million records
    worldwide, while two of their singles "Aerials" and "Hypnotize" reached number one on Billboard's Alternative Songs
    chart.

<h2>Artistry</h2>
<p>wounded love letter".[61] "Boom!", among the band's most straightforward and unambiguous songs, lambasts
    globalization and spending on bombs and armament.[62] Commenting on the track "I-E-A-I-A-I-O", drummer John Dolmayan
    said it was inspired by an encounter he had with Knight Rider's actor David Hasselhoff in a liquor store in Los
    Angeles when he was around 12.[63] On Mezmerize, "Cigaro" makes explicit references to phallic imagery[64] and
    bureaucracy[58] while "Violent Pornography" harshly views television[64] and degradation of women.[65] System of a
    Down's discontent towards the controversial Iraq War arises in "B.Y.O.B.",[58][66] which is a double entendre
    reference to beer and bombs,[67] containing the forthright lyric "Why don't presidents fight the war? Why do they
    always send the poor?",[58][64][65] paraphrasing Black Sabbath's War Pigs, "Old School Hollywood" describes a
    celebrity baseball game.[65][68] On their album "Hypnotize", "Tentative" describes war,[69][70] "Hypnotize" refers
    to the Tiananmen Square events,[71][72] and "Lonely Day" describes angst.[68] The album title Steal This Album! is a
    play on the book Steal This Book by left-wing political activist Abbie Hoffman.[62][73][74] System of a Down's firm
    commitment for the recognition of the Armenian genocide emerges in two songs: "P.L.U.C.K." and "Holy Mountains",
    which rank among the band's most political songs.[70]

    Music
    Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated "Like many late-'90s metal bands System of a Down struck a balance
    between '80s underground thrash metal and metallic early-'90s alternative rockers like Jane's Addiction".[75] System
    of a Down's music has variously been termed alternative metal,[75][76][77][78][79] nu metal,[80][81][82][83][84]
    heavy metal,[75][85] hard rock,[86][87][88] progressive metal,[89][90][91] thrash metal,[92][93][94] art
    rock,[95][96] and avant-garde metal.[97][95] Malakian has stated that "We don't belong to any one scene"[98] and
    that "I don't like the nu-metal drop-A 7-string guitar sound; it is not my thing, at least not yet."[99] In
    interview with Mike Lancaster, he also said, "People always seem to feel the need to put us into a category, but we
    just don't fit into any category."[100] According to Tankian, "As far as arrangement and everything, [our music] is
    pretty much pop. To me, System of a Down isn't a progressive band. [...] But it's not a typical pop project,
    obviously. We definitely pay attention to the music to make sure that it's not something someone's heard
    before."[101]

    The band has used a wide range of instruments, such as electric mandolins, baritone electric guitars, acoustic
    guitars, ouds, sitars, and twelve string guitars.[102] According to Malakian, he would often write songs in E♭
    tuning, which would later be changed to drop C tuning in order to be performed by the band.[99] Malakian states that
    "For me, the drop-C tuning is right down the center. It has enough of the clarity and the crisp sound—most of our
    riffy stuff is done on the top two strings, anyway—but it's also thicker and ballsier."[99]

    Influences and comparison to other artists
    System of a Down's influences include Middle Eastern music,[103] Ozzy Osbourne,[98][103] Black Sabbath,[104] Led
    Zeppelin,[104] Def Leppard,[105] Scorpions,[105] Morbid Angel,[105] Death,[105] Obituary,[105] Eazy-E,[105]
    N.W.A,[105] Run-DMC,[105] Umm Kulthum,[105] Abdel Halim Hafez,[105] the Bee Gees,[105] Grateful Dead,[105] The

    Chains,[109] Iron Maiden,[110] Bad Brains,[107] Slayer,[103][111] and Kiss.[112] One reviewer claimed that their
    music encompasses different sounds, from sounding like "Fugazi playing Rush" to sometimes "tread[ing] close to Frank
    Zappa territory."[113] Malakian has stated that "I'm a fan of music. I'm not necessarily a fan of any one
    band."[114] Dolmayan stated "I don't think we sound like anybody else. I consider us System of a Down."[115]
    Odadjian stated "You can compare us to whoever you want. I don't care. Comparisons and labels have no effect on this
    band. Fact is fact: We are who we are and they are who they are."</p>
