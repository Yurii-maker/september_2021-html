    <div class="discription"><p><strong>Game of Thrones</strong> is an American fantasy drama television series created
        by David Benioff
        and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R.
        R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia,
        Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on
        May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.

        Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has a large ensemble cast and follows
        several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven
        Kingdoms of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim the
        throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the
        realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the throne.
        The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond Westeros's
        northern border.

        Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan base.
        Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values,
        although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) has been subject to criticism. The
        final season received significant critical backlash for its reduced length and creative decisions, with many
        considering it a disappointing conclusion. The series received 59 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama
        series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. Its other awards and nominations
        include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation, a Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden
        Globe Award for Best Television Series â€“ Drama. Many critics and publications have named the show as one of the
        best television series of all time.

            <div class="discription2"><p><strong>Daenerys Targaryen</strong> is portrayed by Emilia Clarke. She is
                the
                exiled princess of the
                Targaryen dynasty. She and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert's
                Rebellion.
                For seventeen years, she has been under her volatile brother's care. In exchange for an army,
                Viserys
                marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo. When Drogo dies, Daenerys uses his funeral
                pyre
                to
                birth three dragons. She later conquers and rules over Slaver's Bay with a large army, eventually
                defeating
                the slave masters with her dragons. She leaves the region behind for Westeros, however, in a bid to
                reclaim
                her birthright: the Iron Throne. Upon her arrival in Westeros, she meets with Jon Snow, the King in
                the
                North, who convinces her to defeat the White Walkers before pressing her claim to the throne. The
                pair
                soon
                fall in love. In Westeros, she loses numerous friends and discovers that the people do not support
                her
                claim, while two of her dragons perish. Faced with no option but to rule through fear, she uses her
                last
                dragon, Drogon, to destroy King's Landing and take the Iron Throne by force. She is assassinated by
                Jon
                Snow
                in the aftermath.</p></div>

                    perceived
                    as a sort of medieval realism. George R.R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like
                    historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on
                    battles,
                    political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic
                    fantasy
                    genre. Martin has said that, "the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and
                    Dark
                    Lords, but from ourselves". Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval which focuses on
                    the
                    overlapping of medieval history and popular fantasy. A common theme in the fantasy genre is
                    the
                    battle between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world.[26] Martin explores
                    the
                    relationship between good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change.[27] The
                    series
                    allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective, unlike in many other
                    fantasies.

                    In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were
                    regularly
                    killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers. Martin stated in an
                    interview
                    that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main
                    characters could be injured or killed.[30] In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain
                    characters
                    had
                    developed "plot armor" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones
                    deviating
                    from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.[29] In a 2012 study, out of 40
                    recent
                    television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.[31] A
                    scientific
                    study conducted in 2018 stated that about 60% of the major characters died as a result violence and
                    war.[32]

                    Inspirations and derivations
                    Although the series's first season closely follows the events of the first novel, there were
                    significant
                    changes made for later seasons. According to Benioff, the TV adaptation is "about adapting the
                    series as
                    a
                    whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not
                    necessarily
                    each of the stops along the way". Aspects of the novels' plots and their adaptations are based upon
                    settings, characters, and events in European history. Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high
                    medieval
                    Europe, from its geography and castles to its cultures, the feudal system, palace intrigues, and the
                    knights' tournaments. Like medieval Europe, most of the houses in the series use the patriarchal
                    system of power. The series also includes elements of gothic fiction, including torture tropes.

                    A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455â€“1485) between the
                    houses
                    of
                    Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin's houses of Lannister and Stark.[39] The scheming Cersei
                    Lannister
                    evokes Isabella, the "She-Wolf of France" (1295â€“1358).[34] She and her family, as portrayed in
                    Maurice
                    Druon's historical novel series, The Accursed Kings, were a main inspiration of Martin's.[40] Other
                    historical antecedents of series elements include: Hadrian's Wall (which becomes Martin's Wall), the
                    Roman
                    Empire, and the legend of Atlantis (ancient Valyria), Byzantine Greek fire ("wildfire"), Icelandic
                    sagas
                    of
                    the Viking Age (the Ironborn), the Mongol hordes (the Dothraki), the Hundred Years' War, and the
                    Italian
                    Renaissance.[34] The series's popularity has been attributed, in part, to Martin's skill at fusing
                    these
                    elements into a seamless, credible version of alternate history.</p></div>
