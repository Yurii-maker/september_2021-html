        <P><strong>Rick and Morty</strong> is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin
            Roiland and Dan Harmon
            for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block, Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of
            cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted, but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split
            their
            time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.</P>
        <P> Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing
            the
            rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the
            Future, created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series has
            been
            acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.</P>
        <P> The current fifth season premiered on June 20, 2021, and consists of ten episodes. A sixth season was
            confirmed as part of a long-term deal in May 2018 that ordered 70 new episodes over an unspecified
            number of
            seasons.</P>
        <h2>Premise and main characters</h2>
        <p>The show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents
            Jerry and Beth, their children Summer and Morty, and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as
            a
            guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of Seattle, Washington.[3] The adventures
            of
            Rick and Morty, however, take place across an infinite number of realities, with the characters
            travelling
            to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying car.</p>
        <p> Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist, who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school,
            marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a
            kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose naïve but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to
            Rick's
            Machiavellian ego. Morty's 17-year-old sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about
            improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures. The kids'
            mother, Beth, is a generally level-headed person and assertive force in the household, though
            self-conscious
            about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a
            simple-minded and insecure person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family.</p>
        <p> Different versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the show's multiverse and their
            personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The show's original Rick identifies
            himself
            as "Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-137", in reference to his original universe, but this does not
            necessarily apply to every other member of the Smith household. For instance, in the first-season
            episode
            "Rick Potion #9", after turning the entire world population into monsters, Rick and Morty move to a
            different dimension, leaving Summer, Beth and Jerry behind.</p>
        <h2>Themes and analysis</h2>
        <h3>Comedic style</h3>
        <p>The general formula of Rick and Morty consists of the juxtaposition of two conflicting scenarios: an
            extremely selfish, alcoholic grandfather dragging his grandson along for interdimensional adventures,
            intercut with domestic family drama.[26][28] Co-creator Dan Harmon has described the series as a cross
            between Matt Groening's two shows The Simpsons and Futurama, balancing family life with heavy science
            fiction.[32] The series is inspired by British-style storytelling, as opposed to traditional American
            family TV stories.[24] Harmon has stated that his inspiration behind much of the concept and humor for
            the series comes from various British television series, such as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
            and Doctor Who. He figures that the audience will only understand developments from Morty's point of
            view, but stated "we don't want to be the companions. We want to hang out with the Doctor, we idolize
            the Doctor, but we don't think like him, and that's really interesting."[42]

            Occasionally, characters will acknowledge an episode's narrative or hint at the presence of a fourth
            wall, suggesting that they are aware of the fact that they are characters of a TV show. Thereunder, Troy
            Patterson of The New Yorker notes that Rick and Morty "supplies an artful answer to the question of what
            follows postmodernism: a decadent regurgitation of all its tropes, all at once, leavened by some
            humanistic wistfulness."[43] Sean Sebastian of Junkee says that the show can be both hilarious and
            deeply disturbing at the same time as it excels at the "intersection between big ideas, flippancy and
            wit."</p>
